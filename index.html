                                America 2021 at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is Argentina's first
                                title since 1993 and 15th Copa America title.
                                Angel Di Maria's 22nd minute strike proved enough as the Albiceleste showed great
                                composure
                                and determination in defence to keep the Selecao out, a feat none of the teams have
